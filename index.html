        <h1 class="hoho">Kpop demon hunter</h1>
        <p> By day, they’re the biggest girl group in the world glittering lights, screaming fans, sold-out arenas. Their names are on every billboard. Their dances, iconic. Their songs, chart-topping. The world sees perfection. But behind the stage… lies a secret they’ve sworn to protect.

By night, they become something else demon hunters.

When an ancient evil rises in modern-day Seoul, threatening to consume the city in darkness, only one group stands in its way not soldiers, not superheroes, but a team of K-pop idols with mystical weapons and a bond forged in fire.

Each girl brings more than just talent. One commands blades made of light. Another controls sound waves with her voice. One can open portals between dimensions. Together, they face off against shape-shifting monsters, cursed spirits, and their own haunted pasts.

As their fame grows, so does the danger because the demons aren’t just hiding in the shadows anymore. They’ve started to infiltrate the world of music, fame, and power.

Now, under the flashing lights of their biggest world tour, the girls must fight their greatest battle yet  not just to save their fans… but to save each other.

Because in this world, being an idol isn’t just about the music.
It’s about surviving the darkness behind it.</p>
